# MEME AMPLIFIER CONTRACT
A Collective Protocol usecase. This contract is a fork of Collective Protocol modified for the specific usecase of the Meme Amplifier Machine.

## Meme Aplifier Machine
Using our learnings from Clash of Channels, where we got ~2,000 casters from 16 FC channels to play as a collective for their channel, we are creating a tool to align community members’ incentive to spread the meme. 

### Here’s how it’ll work:
1. A collective contract is created for all participating channels
2. When creators create their meme frame, they do so under a chosen collective
3. All mints from the meme frame is done through the chosen collective
4. On mint, creators are recorded as participants to the collective pool, along with the number of mints as their contribution
3. Revenue generated from mints is split 50/50 between the creator and the community’s treasury of the collective choosen
